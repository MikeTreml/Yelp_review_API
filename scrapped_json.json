Everyone loved their food, even telling me, \"This is the best food I've had since the Coronavirus came along!\"Staff both on the phone and in the restaurant were pleasant and efficient. My order was ready exactly when they said it would be and was fantastic. My Prime Dip sandwich was a great size and I love that they didn't skimp on the au jus like so many places tend to do. It was big enough that I was able to save the other half for later and it warmed up nicely. The house chips were definitely top-tier as well.I really can't say enough about their ranch as well. I was annoyed that it was $1 extra to get it with the chips, but I'd drink it, it's so good!",

Sauteed brings out the carrot's sweetness and the spices add excellent flavor.

We had a party of 11, and the crowded bar and tiny dining area contributed to a very long wait. The crew at Swingin' Door did their best to accommodate us, but the place just isn't built for large groups.But, if you have a small party and are looking for good drinks and great bar food (and you don't mind a crowded, lively spot), the Swingin' Door will fit the bill. The place doesn't take reservations, so plan for a wait and enjoy a drink at the bar. There is no parking, but you can find spots on the street or use one of the lots or structures (such as the Third Ward lot under the freeway or the Chase Bank structure on Water.)The Swingin' Door is a place rich in history. It's a 1930s tavern located in an 1879 building. The place is largely untouched by time, and it may look a bit like a dive bar, but it's much too clean and well-maintained for that. Instead, it's a comfortable, old, welcoming spot for a drink and a bite.The bar area is cozy--a couple of dozen people would fill all the chairs, and on popular evenings, making your way to the restrooms can be a bit challenging. But, because this is Milwaukee and the Swingin' Door seems to inspire sociability, you'll generally find people willing to squeeze out of the way with a smile, even when the place is packed.The dining room is equally cozy, and a couple of dozen people would also come close to filling every available seat. Service is friendly, and the food is terrific. The menu is full of delicious comfort food. The housemade chips with blue cheese dip are very tasty. The burgers and sandwiches, which range from $10 to $15, are great. I enjoyed the messy but delicious Grilled Russian, with roast beef, corned beef, coleslaw, and cheese on grilled marble rye. My dining companions who ordered the Saturday NY Strip special ($14.95!) had no complaints.Some people rave about the fries here, but I found them merely good--but the folks who ordered the Vermouth Carrots raved.I used to come here decades ago, and for a while, it seemed the Swingin' Door might not survive. But in 2010, K. C. Swan and Shelley Sincere purchased the place, upgraded the food, and kept everything that makes Swingin' Door such a terrific, comfortable, historic spot.Check out the daily specials on the website. Happy Hour is offered seven days a week with $3.50 Smirnoff Cocktails or three cans of Pabst, Hamms, Rolling Rock Or Coors for $5.",

They have a full bar and lots of beer on draft. For dinner I went with the Blackened Chicken Bacon Avocado sandwich, which is rare for me because I almost never order chicken at restaurants but it had such great reviews so I went for it. I also got a side of their mashed potatoes, it was a special for the night. It was so good! The bacon was so crispy and the chicken was perfectly blackened, Yelp didn't let me down on that one. My boyfriend ordered the Patty Melt and said it was delicious as well.Overall, a really cool little joint to grab drinks and food! Prices were very reasonable as well.

My boyfriend and I went at 5:30 on a Friday night and found the restaurant was already pretty busy! Nice casual relaxing vibe and cool warm-tone interior design.We started with the Brussels Sprouts w Candied pecans and sriracha aioli. The brussels sprouts were deep fried to be super crispy (in case you think they are grilled) and went so well with the creamy and slightly spicy sriracha aioli. Yum! We two finished the whole plate in like 5 mins.My veggie melt contained generous portion of vegetables. The grilled cheese, mushroom and onions and avocado in between two slices of perfectly toasted and buttered bread were delicious! The only thing I didn't like about the sandwich was the raw cucumber inside - they were not refreshing and cold any more because everything else in the sandwich were cooked. So they were kind of watery and tasteless and added a weird texture. Personally I think they should use grilled zucchini instead.My boyfriend enjoyed his sriracha chicken sandwich a lot! I took a bite of it and could not agree more! Nicely seasoned! The bread was, again, so perfectly grilled with butter and had a crispy texture! The chicken was yummy - moist inside and crispy outside.Sides: my grilled beets were good. Given I am not a beet fan, I think I still enjoyed them. My boyfriend's onion rings were nothing really special, but did come in a generous portion.Bonus: I came here like a year before and got their chicken avocado bacon sandwich at that time. I could not remember the details but recalled I felt really good about it. That is why I wanted to come back and also showed the restaurant to my boyfriend.",
